2. move from mouse interaction to a more tactile approach (ipads with stylus...)
3. 3d building enevelope

    -   zoom in, zoom out automatically based on height or building size.
4. integrate with localized price calculations for materials, rent, land value, etc based on APIs and web scraping.
4. when you are building a prototype or dev type, inputs should not be visible unless they are optional or required. this will make the forms less intimitdating
5. add switch/toggle for US vs Metric System
6. create PowerUser excel editing interface for updating formulas OR SQL(?)

9. import geojson | shp
10. export CAD | BIM | 3D stuff
11. message board for questions about the data or the tool?
