        BUG TRACKER 
/************************/ 
- load, edit and save user profile
- tie library to user
- need loading thingy for when you paint and are waiting for a draw
- basemap needs to be added with toggle between aerial, simple, etc. //openstreetmap tile_servers
---- combine hillshading and OSM toner for badass base map
- no profile page
- gallery should be split between buildings, maps, and development types
- development types need a visualization of some kind
- building 3d component needs to adjust with size of sitearea
- building check error (saw in post-build)
- get user image from google img
- document service worker error for future self
- test building update and the corresponding metric change in the map
- upload geojson capability,
---- can we test for file type?
---- copy arcmap style
- we need a simpler file / file save as / save / load sample building data / export to excel, txt / print
- charts dont update except on paint ... 
- mapping needs to be xs=12 sm=8 so painting changes are more readily visible

- paypal donate button
- leaflet layer on click function loads only once. after layer update, stops working
- protected routes for USERS
- move from mouse interaction to a more tactile approach (ipads with stylus...)
- 3d building enevelope
    -   give basic options: U-shape, L-shape, Block, Rectangle
    -   zoom in, zoom out automatically based on height or building size.
- integrate with localized price calculations for materials, rent, land value, etc based on APIs and web scraping.
- when you are building a prototype or dev type, inputs should not be visible unless they are optional or required. this will make the forms less intimitdating
- new SQL tables for drop and reload DEV/TEST/PROD
- add switch/toggle for US vs Metric System
- create PowerUser excel editing interface for updating formulas OR SQL(?)
- import Old excel ROIs function
- export excel ROIs
- import geojson | shapefile
- export CAD | BIM | 3D stuff
- export geojson | shapefile
- message board for questions about the data or the tool? community?
- integrate with machine learning classifier....
- create messaging forum
- where can we store files (e.g. s3)?
- build contact page and contact method....
- set up messaging system
- replace lodash with native functions for speed purposes
