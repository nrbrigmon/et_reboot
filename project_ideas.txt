---- BUILDING & DEV TYPES BUGS
        - development types need a visualization of some kind
        - building 3d component needs to adjust with size of sitearea

- paypal donate button
- protected routes for USERS
- move from mouse interaction to a more tactile approach (ipads with stylus...)
- integrate with localized price calculations for materials, rent, land value, etc based on APIs and web scraping.
- when you are building a prototype or dev type, inputs should not be visible unless they are optional or required. this will make the forms less intimitdating
- new SQL tables for drop and reload DEV/TEST/PROD
- add switch/toggle for US vs Metric System
- create PowerUser excel editing interface for updating formulas OR SQL(?)
- import Old excel ROIs function
- export excel ROIs
- export CAD | BIM | 3D stuff
- export geojson | shapefile
- message board for questions about the data or the tool? community?
- integrate with machine learning classifier....
- create messaging forum/system OR harness a third-party messenging system/forum
- replace lodash with native functions for speed purposes
- uber.github.io has some awesome geospatial libraries to integrate (kepler, luma, reactviz)
