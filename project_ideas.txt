*** select get layer from s3 (and metadata?)
*** after layer uploads adjust properties to load
*** add loading animation component

---- STEPS TO DEMO
        - create manual building types list:
                - austin list (short-term) (x20)
                        - get from old projects in ET Folder
                - brazil list (long-term) (xProject based)
                        - using dev types from KStiphany project board in emails, create custom variations
        - create development types list:
                - austin list (short-term) (based on CodeNEXT zoning)
                        - get from old projects in ET folder
                - brazil list (long-term) (xProject based)
                        - get from KStiphany project board in emails
        - ALSO worth investigating.... i can load via python scripts... would be worth creating.... 

        - create building types (STEP ONE)
        - create development types (STEP TWO) 

        - HOW DO I ENSURE I CAN LOAD EVERTYHING at snap of button?
        - HOW DO I REVERT BACK TO ANOTHER PROFILE OR LIBRARY?
                - should be load and clear library?
                - create clear and load myDevelopmentWorkbook %s and values button?
                
        - create cloned mapping page, which does the following:
                - loads canned building library
                - loads canned development types
        - create at least two more metrics
        - show side-by-side before and after page 
        - HOUSECLeaning: i need to decouple my actions page the same way as i have for my reducers
        - HOW DO I MIGRATE specific data to PROD instance?

---- GENERAL BUGS
        - We want brazil and austin demo.... does this mean we need to sets of metrics (Hectares and Acres)
        - need loading thingy for when you paint and are waiting for a draw
        - build contact method for contact page.... (what did my nrbmaps use?)
        - instead of VIEW DEMO we could also have a 1.5 minute video that walks through full process

---- MAPPING BUGS
        - basemap needs to be added with toggle between aerial, simple, etc. //openstreetmap tile_servers
        - combine hillshading and OSM toner for badass base map
        - test building update and the corresponding metric change in the map
        - create side by side metrics with WIDER screen, xs=12 sm=8 
        - upload geojson capability, can we test for file type, model after arcmap upload
        - where can we store files after geojson upload (e.g. s3)?
        - charts dont update except on paint ... need to update on ComponentDidMount

---- BUILDING & DEV TYPES BUGS
        - development types need a visualization of some kind
        - building 3d component needs to adjust with size of sitearea
        - give basic options: U-shape, L-shape, Block, Rectangle
        - we need a simpler file / file save as / save / load sample building data / export to excel, txt / print

---- USER BUGS (Priority 4)
        - load, edit and save user profile (also callback error on login)
        - tie library to user
        - get user image from google img
        - show profile page, ONLY if logged in        
        - list other users and CONTACT/MESSAGE button

---- GALLERY BUGS (Priority 5)
        - gallery should be split between buildings, maps, and development types

- tiered access to data library


/************************/
        LONG TERM IDEAS
/************************/ 

- paypal donate button
- leaflet layer on click function loads only once. after layer update, stops working
- protected routes for USERS
- move from mouse interaction to a more tactile approach (ipads with stylus...)
- integrate with localized price calculations for materials, rent, land value, etc based on APIs and web scraping.
- when you are building a prototype or dev type, inputs should not be visible unless they are optional or required. this will make the forms less intimitdating
- new SQL tables for drop and reload DEV/TEST/PROD
- add switch/toggle for US vs Metric System
- create PowerUser excel editing interface for updating formulas OR SQL(?)
- import Old excel ROIs function
- export excel ROIs
- export CAD | BIM | 3D stuff
- export geojson | shapefile
- message board for questions about the data or the tool? community?
- integrate with machine learning classifier....
- create messaging forum/system OR harness a third-party messenging system/forum
- replace lodash with native functions for speed purposes
- uber.github.io has some awesome geospatial libraries to integrate (kepler, luma, reactviz)
