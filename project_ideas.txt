        LONG TERM IDEAS
/************************/ 

- paypal donate button
- protected routes for USERS
- move from mouse interaction to a more tactile approach (ipads with stylus...)
- 3d building enevelope
    -   give basic options: U-shape, L-shape, Block, Rectangle
    -   zoom in, zoom out automatically based on height or building size.
- integrate with localized price calculations for materials, rent, land value, etc based on APIs and web scraping.
- when you are building a prototype or dev type, inputs should not be visible unless they are optional or required. this will make the forms less intimitdating
- add switch/toggle for US vs Metric System
- create PowerUser excel editing interface for updating formulas OR SQL(?)
- import Old excel ROIs function
- export excel ROIs
- import geojson | shapefile
- export CAD | BIM | 3D stuff
- export geojson | shapefile
- message board for questions about the data or the tool? community?
